The final answer was obtained by solving for x in the equation x + 1 = 2, where x is an unknown variable representing a proportion or percentage. By isolating the term x and subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 2 - 1
x = 1

However, this was not used to arrive at the value 0.5. To understand how 0.5 was obtained, we must consider a different mathematical context. Let's assume that x represents a proportion or percentage, and we want to find the value of x such that:

1 + x = 2.5

Subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 1.5 - 0.5
x = 0.5
