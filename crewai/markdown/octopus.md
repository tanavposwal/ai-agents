The blue-ringed octopus is a deep-sea species of octopus found in the exclusive economic zones of several countries. It has a scientific name of *Goniatites gigas* and is known for its large, conical mouthparts that are used to ring and attach itself to hard surfaces like rocks or sponges. These rings help it stay anchored while swimming freely on the ocean floor. The octopus is also known for its bright blue coloration, which helps it blend into its surroundings to avoid detection by predators.

- It can reach a maximum size of about 50 cm (19.7 inches) and weighs between 183 grams (64 ounces) and 270 grams (9.5 pounds).  
- The blue-ringed octopus is one of the few deep-sea octopuses that are not parasitic, meaning it doesn't feed on its host but instead preys directly on small fish and plankton.  
- Its unique defense mechanism involves releasing a series of electric pulses through its tentacles to stun prey or defend against predators.  
- The octopus has a lifespan of up to 10 years in the wild, making it one of the longest-living ocean animals known.  
- It is highly intelligent and can navigate complex environments, often staying at least 5,000 meters (about 7 nautical miles) below the ocean surface when not near land.  
- The blue-ringed octopus belongs to the family *Goniatitidae* and is classified as a cnidarian, sharing characteristics with other sea creatures like jellyfish and sea anemones.  
- Interestingly, it can taste most unappetizing things, including metal, oil, and certain chemicals, but they are not harmful to it.
